This project is a full-stack Netflix clone that replicates the streaming platformâ€™s interface and functionality using React on the front end and Node.js with Express on the backend. The front end displays movie thumbnails, trailers, and categories in a responsive layout, styled with HTML, CSS, and React Icons. React-Redux manages state for efficient loading and user interactions, while Axios enables seamless API requests for dynamic content updates. Firebase is used for user authentication, storing login data securely, and supporting user sessions. The backend, built with Node.js, Express, and Mongoose for MongoDB integration, handles user data and watchlists, with CORS ensuring secure data communication. Nodemon streamlines development by updating the server in real time. This project provides a comprehensive learning experience in front-to-back development, state management, and user authentication.
This Project contains a Chatbot , this agent, powered by the Gemini API, aims to enhance the user experience by providing real-time, personalized movie and TV show recommendations based on natural language queries.
